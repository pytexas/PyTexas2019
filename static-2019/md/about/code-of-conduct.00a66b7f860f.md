PyTexas is dedicated to providing a harassment-free conference experience for
everyone, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical
appearance, body size, race, or religion. We do not tolerate harassment of
conference participants in any form.

All communication should be appropriate for a professional audience including
people of many different backgrounds. Sexual language and imagery is not
appropriate for any conference venue, including talks.

Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down other attendees. Behave
professionally. Remember that harassment and sexist, racist, or exclusionary
jokes are not appropriate for PyTexas.

Attendees violating these rules may be asked to leave the conference without a
refund at the sole discretion of the conference organizers. We prioritize marginalized people's safety over privileged people's comfort.

**If you believe an individual has violated this Code of Conduct, please contact us via any of the following methods.**
