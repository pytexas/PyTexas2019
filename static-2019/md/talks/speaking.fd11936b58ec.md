The submission deadline for proposals is TBD.

## Talks

Talks may be either 20 or 50 minutes, though for exceptional proposals other
talk durations may be considered.

If you have an idea for a presentation that doesn’t fit the above guidelines,
please submit it anyway. If it’s interesting enough, we’ll arrange our program
around it.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Who should submit a proposal?

Everyone! We want all kinds of proposals from people of all experience levels.
Whether you’ve never given a talk at a conference, or have given dozens.
Whether you just discovered Python, or are an old hand. Whether you’re a
programmer, designer, scientist, or music theorist (or whatever). We want to
hear what you have to share!

### What should I give a talk on?

Your talk can be about anything related to the Python programming language or
of interest to the Python community. Some specific areas that people have
expressed interest in for talks this year include:

* General Python programming
* Web Applications
* GIS
* Scientific Computing
* Data Visualization

Some other ideas might be:
* How you used Python to solve a specific problem.
* Your favorite Python library
* How to broaden diversity within the Python community.
* Development tools for Python (or written in Python)
* etc.

### Does PyTexas offer any financial support for speakers?

PyTexas does not currently offer financial support specifically for speakers.
Since PyTexas is a community driven, not for profit conference, all speakers
are required to purchase a ticket and provide accommodations for themselves.
PyTexas does have a fund for financial assistance, and speakers are welcome to
apply for those funds. However, the assistance funds are limited and are used
mainly with general attendees in mind.

## Lightning talks
